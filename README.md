# Customer-Success-Best-Practices
List of Best Practices for Customer Success


-	To justify CS budget need to show: Cost vs, Rev; $ increase in US and XS; $ increase in retention
-	Avg CS budget is about 3.5% of company revs
-	CSM:Ctm ratio is now 1:15 and was 1:10 last years – due to efficiency and Low Touch tech
-	TO SCALE ONE Must invest in Low Touch, work with Partners [Partner CSMs who are trained/certified, NEED PARTNER PORTAL] and Analytics.  Studies show NPS does not suffer due to Low Touch.
-	LAER = Land, Adopt, Expand, Renew.  PUT THE RIGHT RESOURCES AT THE POINT IN THE CTM JOURNEY THAT DELIVERS THE BEST CX IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER.
-	Analytics evolved from Predictive Churn/Retention [36% do this] to Predictive Expansion [21% do this] to Predictive ctm achievement against their desired Outcomes.
-	In addition to doing a Journey you need to live it thru out all teams.  They need to be actively involved to Operationalize The Journey.  That means changing their processes, measurements, etc....
-	1. Invest in CS.  2. Align incentives across teams.  3. Expand Engagement Mktg.  4. Process Optimization – ctms expect us to be experts and help them optimize.  5. Invest in Early Warning System [Gainsight] to quickly mitigate issues.
-	Need a person or team focused on Analytics and Insights.
-	Communication is King and must have clear roles and responsibilities
-	Consumption Data is key - how they use and issues.  High Adopters renew at higher rates.
-	Our KPI’s need to be directly related to ctms Outcomes.  Analytics can help in determining which KPIs result in desired ctm Outcomes and their priority
-	Consumption based triggers and follow on actions result in increased US and XS
-	Need to train CSMs on selling – see slide
-	Need to be careful with using quotas on CSMs – try gamification points, etc.  See slide
-	CSMs can close US but must be ctm first and the transactions need to be Simple, Transactional, Analytics Driver and Repeatable such that the CSM labor and risk is very low.
-	CSM SUCCESS = GREAT CX + GREAT CTM OUTCOME [need to show ctm the Outcome data]
-	To effectively Scale you need to have effective relationships with sister teams.  For example, CSM can do band-aides for Product issues to keep customer happy when the root cause is improving the product for next release or immediately.  Feedback to Mktg for Product Roadmap.
-	CSM AND PRODUCT MGMT ARE NEW IMPORTANT COLLABORATION PARTNERS FOR SUCCESS.
-	CSM SHOULD NOT BE COGS IT SHOULD BE COS – as it is a growth driver.
-	See Ctm Succ Maturity curve
-	Companies need to improve on Tech Touch elements and breaking down Silos.
-	Need to do In-App engagements – feedback and surveys

Leadership:
-	Lead by inspiration not by dictation
-	Ask questions
-	Listen more than talking
-	Be VOC and carry through organization
-	Learn about employees and ctms – their desires and input
-	Kind and inclusive environment

List of Best Practices for Customer Success


-	To justify CS budget need to show: Cost vs, Rev; $ increase in US and XS; $ increase in retention
-	Avg CS budget is about 3.5% of company revs
-	CSM:Ctm ratio is now 1:15 and was 1:10 last years â€“ due to efficiency and Low Touch tech
-	TO SCALE ONE Must invest in Low Touch, work with Partners [Partner CSMs who are trained/certified, NEED PARTNER PORTAL] and Analytics.  Studies show NPS does not suffer due to Low Touch.
-	LAER = Land, Adopt, Expand, Renew.  PUT THE RIGHT RESOURCES AT THE POINT IN THE CTM JOURNEY THAT DELIVERS THE BEST CX IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER.
-	Analytics evolved from Predictive Churn/Retention [36% do this] to Predictive Expansion [21% do this] to Predictive ctm achievement against their desired Outcomes.
-	In addition to doing a Journey you need to live it thru out all teams.  They need to be actively involved to Operationalize The Journey.  That means changing their processes, measurements, etc.
